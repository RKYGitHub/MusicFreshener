MusicFreshener
==============

Android app to help keep music fresh

Add new albums on the "Add New Music" screen (via the nav drawer).
When an album is eligible for listening according to the rules (default 30 days/album and 7 days/artist), it will show up in the "Listen To Today" screen. Long-press an item to log it as listened on the current day. 
All records are shown in descending chronological order on the "Listening History" screen. Long-press also works from here for times the user wants to cheat.
